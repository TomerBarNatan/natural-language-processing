The model's accuracy on the validation set, evaluated using the provided in-context examples and CoT was 0.7.\\
We note that there was a one to one correspondence between correct final answers and correct explanations.\\
Out of all the answers, 70\% of the explanations were correct (according to my opinion).\\
In none (0\%) of the validation examples did the model produce a correct final answer with an unconvincing explanation.
